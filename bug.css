The CSS property `calc()` is used incorrectly, leading to unexpected layout or styling issues.  For example, using `calc(100% - 10px)` inside a flexbox container might not work as expected if the container's width isn't defined.  Another issue is using `calc()` with units inconsistently, such as `calc(100px + 10%)`, which can lead to calculation errors depending on the browser's interpretation.  Also, missing or incorrect parentheses within nested `calc()` expressions can cause parsing errors.
